# Created a Entity Relationship model.
# Each entity is an entity object in Springboot backend app.
# Developed Service repository and controller layers.
# Headend is the component that recieves the rest requests.
# Repository has each entity repository that extends JPA for java app to interact with the sql database.
# Application properties file is used to configure the spring app endpoint(Hotel management service endpoint )
# It also has database config.
# run maven clean install and start the springboot app by cloning this repository.
# that will make the app to run on local host 8080.
# use the same endpint for testing.




Spring Boot Hotel Management Service
This repository contains a Spring Boot application for a Hotel Management Service. The application leverages Spring Data JPA for database interactions and follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Here's how you can get started with setting up, configuring, and running the application.

Overview
The application is structured as follows:

Entity Layer: Each entity represents a database table, defined as an entity object in Spring Boot.
Repository Layer: Interfaces for each entity, extending Spring Data JPA to interact with the SQL database.
Service Layer: Business logic and service-level operations.
Controller Layer: REST API endpoints handling HTTP requests.
Headend: Component that receives and processes REST requests.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

JDK 11 or newer
Maven 3.6 or newer
MySQL Server 5.7 or newer (or another compatible SQL database)
Configuration
Before running the application, configure the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory. Here is what you typically need to configure:

properties
Copy code
# Spring Datasource Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotel_management
spring.datasource.username=<your-database-username>
spring.datasource.password=<your-database-password>

# Hibernate Properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# Application server port
server.port=8080
Replace <your-database-username> and <your-database-password> with your actual database credentials.

Building the Application
To compile the application and build the package, run the following command from the root directory of the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
This command will clean the target directory, compile your sources, and package them into a .jar file located under the target/ directory.

Running the Application
To start the server, execute:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/hotel-management-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Alternatively, if you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can run the application by executing the main method from the HotelManagementServiceApplication class.

Testing the Application
Once the application is running, it will be accessible via http://localhost:8080. You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or Curl. Here are a few examples of how you can interact with the application:

bash
Copy code
# Get a list of all hotels
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/hotels

# Create a new hotel
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/hotels -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Hotel Sunshine", "address": "123 Sunny Street"}'
Replace the endpoint paths and data with relevant endpoints and data according to your application's API specifications.
